# ColorWheel

Color Wheel is a color matching game programmed in JavaFX. 

When the player presses space, the pointer will start rotating. 
The player must press space again when the color of the pointer 
matches a color in the color wheel to earn a point. If the 
pointer passes over the right color without the player pressing 
space or the player mismatches the color, the game ends. Every 
subsequent press of the space bar will change the color of the 
pointer and its rotation direction. After a certain number of points
earned, the next level with more colors will start.
