# ColorWheel

Color Wheel is a color matching game. When the player presses space,
the pointer will start rotating. The player must press space again
when the color of the pointer matches a color in the color wheel to
earn a point. If the pointer passes over the right color without the
player pressing space or the player mismatches the color, the game ends.
Every subsequent press of the space bar will change the color of the
pointer and its rotation direction. After a certain number of points
earned, the next level with more colors will start.
